## 👋 Hi there! I’m a 2nd-year Computer Science student at Bennett University, majoring in AI and ML. Passionate about blending creativity with code, I’m diving into **React**, **Three.js**, and **Machine Learning** to build interactive web experiences. 🚀 

I enjoy tackling **DSA** challenges, honing my problem-solving skills, and creating projects that merge cutting-edge AI with user-focused design. 🌐 Always exploring new ideas and optimizing algorithms, I’m driven to learn, create, and innovate. Let’s connect and push the boundaries of what’s possible! ✨
